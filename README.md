## WEATHER DASHBOARD(Server-side APIs)

## Description:
I created this application to service as a weather dashboard application for future and current weather. You can access cities all around the world and are provided with a 5 day weather forcast for the selected city. I utilized my knowledge of Javascript, API, CSS and many other resources to complete this application. Hopefully it is easy to use as a user and pleasant to view. Enjoy!

## User Story:

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria:

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

```
